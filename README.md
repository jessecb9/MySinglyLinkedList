# MySinglyLinkedList
# Purpose
The goal of this assignment was to create a SinglyLinkedList of Nodes. The header node stores the ArrayList of nodes while there is a pointer node for each county. Then with the accidents.csv file, the reports are sorted based on state and the start/end time. An iterator was implmented to take in the County name with date parameters. To have the user input county, start and end date, the iterator was used to calculate average visbility for the accidents between the dates.
